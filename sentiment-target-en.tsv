ABSA16-DBG#2:11.1	My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten <TARGET>meal</TARGET>, called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant.	negative	1.0	negative
ABSA16-DBG#2:14.1	It wasn't as if this <TARGET>restaurant</TARGET> had any major bragging points before hand, but now it's simply repulsive.	negative	1.0	negative

ABSA16-EVPK#4:3.3	The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the <TARGET>cheese</TARGET> is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components.	positive	1.0	positive

ABSA16-Z#6:3.2	If you’re planning to come here, make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you’ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching (choose the ones on the ground level that have <TARGET>glass ceilings</TARGET> so you may see the stars in the sky!).	positive	1.0	positive

ABSA16-FF#3:10.1	At this point, the <TARGET>waitress</TARGET> comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress WALKED away.	negative	1.0	negative

ABSA16-BFC#7:0.1	Fabulous <TARGET>food</TARGET> - if the front of house staff don't put you off – 	positive	1.0	positive
ABSA16-BFC#7:3.3	Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional <TARGET>fish dishes</TARGET> I would never return. 	positive	1.0	positive
ABSA16-ADLT#6:2.3	The food and service were fine, however the <TARGET>maitre-D</TARGET> was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant.	negative	1.0	negative
ABSA16-ADLT#6:4.1	This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a <TARGET>frontman</TARGET> in a restaurant.	negative	1.0	negative
ABSA16-ADLT#6:6.1	A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the <TARGET>maitre-D</TARGET>'s sense of " table turnover", as whacked as it is, or else.	negative	1.0	negative
